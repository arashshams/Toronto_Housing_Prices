Information on the data source, the historical availability, definitions of the terms used, and the geographies available can be found at <a href=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/72-212-X"" target=""_blank""> Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families"," Individuals and Seniors <span class=""wb-inv""> - opens in a new browser window</span></a>.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persons who are not matched to a family become persons not in census families. They may be living alone, with a family to whom they are related, with a family to whom they are unrelated or with other persons not in census families. Beginning in 2001, same-sex couples reporting as couples are counted as couple families.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting in 2007, median incomes in the data tables are rounded to the nearest ten dollars (prior to 2007 they were rounded to the nearest hundred dollars). Zero values are not included in the calculation of medians for individuals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
